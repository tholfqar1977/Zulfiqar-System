An interactive web-based horror experience designed to "crush" junior developers and test their psychological limits. This project combines eerie design, unsettling audio effects, and psychological tricks to deliver a unique experience.

- Sudden and loud noises (**Screams/Jumpscares**).
- Flashing lights and intense visual effects (**Glitch/Strobe effects**).

* **Interactive Audio System:** Eerie background music and sound effects that react to mouse movements and events (powered by **Howler.js**).
* **Interactive Scenario:** A system that asks "impossible" programming questions and punishes the user for wrong answers.
